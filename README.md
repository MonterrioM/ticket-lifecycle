This screenshot shows me creating a new support ticket in osTicket to simulate a user-submitted issue. I accessed the Open a New Ticket form, filled in the user’s name, email, and selected a help topic. In the message field, I described the problem in detail—for example, "Unable to access company email." After submitting the form, the ticket was generated and added to the system, ready for staff response and tracking.

his screenshot shows me logged in as staff, viewing a newly received ticket in osTicket. I opened the ticket from the dashboard, reviewed the issue details, and assigned it to the appropriate department and help topic/service based on the nature of the problem. This step ensures the ticket is routed to the right team for resolution, streamlining workflow and improving response time within the support system.

This screenshot shows a support ticket open in osTicket, where I’m reviewing the user’s submitted issue but haven’t responded yet. The ticket displays the subject, message details, and user information. I’m currently assessing the problem to determine the appropriate solution before posting a reply. This step reflects the initial phase of ticket handling, where the support agent gathers context to ensure a helpful and accurate response.
